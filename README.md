# Unity Lighting and Effect Equalizer

### About

I initially made this script with the help of [this]() post. The files for the Audio Analyzer will also be included. It is currently being used for my upcoming Cyberpunk Rogue-Like. It allows lighting components, effects, and anything else with float values to be equalized with the scene music/sound. 

Any help making this script better will be greatly appreciated!

## Example of the Script
